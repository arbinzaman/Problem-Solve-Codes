## üìò About the Book

**Eloquent JavaScript** by [Marijn Haverbeke](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a comprehensive guide to learning JavaScript. The book is structured into three main parts:

1. **Language**: Covers the fundamentals of JavaScript, including values, types, operators, program structure, functions, and data structures.
2. **Browser**: Introduces JavaScript's role in web browsers, covering topics like the Document Object Model (DOM), events, and browser-based projects.
3. **Node.js**: Explores server-side JavaScript with Node.js, including modules and asynchronous programming.

The book is available for free online and is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license.

## üß© What I've Solved

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises presented in _Eloquent JavaScript_. The exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts introduced in each chapter. By solving these problems, I've gained hands-on experience with:

- **Basic JavaScript Syntax**: Understanding variables, loops, and conditionals.
- **Functions and Scope**: Writing reusable functions and understanding variable scope.
- **Data Structures**: Working with arrays, objects, and linked lists.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Using functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Handling asynchronous operations using callbacks and promises.
- **Browser Programming**: Interacting with the DOM and handling events.
- **Node.js**: Building server-side applications with Node.js.
