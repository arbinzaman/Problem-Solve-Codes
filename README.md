## Introduction

Welcome to my repository of problem-solving codes! Here, you will find my solutions to problems I've tackled on Codeforces and Beecrowd. These solutions are written in various programming languages and organized by problem categories and difficulty levels.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

## Codeforces

In the `codeforces` directory, you'll find two main subdirectories:

- `contests`: Contains solutions to problems from specific Codeforces contests.
- `practice`: Contains solutions to practice problems, categorized by difficulty level.

## Beecrowd

In the `beecrowd` directory, you will find solutions to problems from the Beecrowd platform. Each problem is stored in its own subdirectory, named after the problem code.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/problem-solving-codes.git
Navigate to the desired directory to find the solution you're interested in.
Open the solution file to view the code.
